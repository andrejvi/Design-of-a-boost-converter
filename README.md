# Abstract

This project involves the design and simulation of a
boost converter, a type of power electronics circuit
used to increase the voltage of a DC power source.
The design process includes selecting appropriate
components such as the inductor, capacitor, and
switch, as well as determining the optimal operating conditions.

The simulation is performed
using LTspice and Simulink to analyze the behavior
of the circuit under different load conditions. For
controlling the circuits voltage and current levels,
the chosen components are a Si-FET transistor and
five SiC-diodes. The chosen capacitors is one 10
mF 350 V electrolytic capacitor and a 12 µF 500V
fast-switching solder pin capacitor. The inductor
is designed to have an inductance of 874µF. The
circuit’s duty cycle is controlled with a PI-regulator,
with the values Kp = 0.3, Ki = 40. The calculated
efficiency is 99%.
